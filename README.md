## EX-6-PSEUDORANDOM-NUMBER-GENERATION
AIM :
To implement Pseudorandom Number Generation using Standard Library.

ALGORITHM :
Step 1:
Get the number of random numbers to generate from the user.

Step 2:
Read the minimum and maximum values for the random number range.

Step 3:
Initialize the random seed using the current time.

Step 4:
Generate a random number by calculating the remainder of division with the range (max - min + 1) and adding the minimum value.

Step 5:
Repeat the random number generation for the specified count.

Step 6:
Print each generated random number.

Step 7:
End the program.
